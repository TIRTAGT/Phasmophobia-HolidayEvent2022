## Contributing New Location Guide
	- Create a folder inside [/locations](/locations/), named with the game location name, such as "Tanglewood Drive".
	- Create and edit these files to your needs 
		- README.md file<br>
	 		This is the file that you should put your guides in, markdown style formatting is very recommended so that the guide can be easily seen and modified.

		- AUTHORS.md file<br>
			This file contains all contributors for the specific location guide, as a contributor, you can put a information about you here !

			I recommend to put your details in a "key: value" format, this makes it easy to read and modify the file.

			You can put basically anything aslong as it is not against GitHub terms of service, is age-insensitive (no NSFW related content), is related to you, and is not too long (there is no exact limit, however please mind that longer content is not easy to maintain).

			However, Please do not put sensitive information even if it is about you on here, the repository is public and may be forever public even if it is taken down as everyone may have a copy of it.

			Example:<br>
			```
				Name: Matthew Tirtawidjaja<br>
				Username: TIRTAGT<br>
				Discord: TIRTAGT TECH#0000<br>
				Email: matthew@tirtagt.xyz
			```


		- images folder<br>
	 		This folder contains all images that the location guide uses, put them here and link them (recommended to use with markdown linking) to the README.md
