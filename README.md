## About the Holiday Event 2022

In a major update (v0.8.0.0), the Phasmophobia Holiday Event 2022 and the update log is announced on the game's [steam announcement](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/739630/view/3651886751537076286).

From the announcement, this event started after the update is live, and lasts until Early January 2023.

To people who have done the event, they will receive a Unique Holiday Trophy, and the exclusive Holiday '22 card and bagde.

The steps to get the trophy can be found by clicking the "Holiday Sticker" on the whiteboard at the lobby.

## The event requirement

The player must :
1. Play the game on Intermediate difficulty
2. Correctly identify the ghost and selecting it on the Journal
3. Find and collect all cookie (6 total in each location)

The 2nd and 3rd requirement may be completed together at the same time, since when identifying the ghost the player may have found the cookies.

----
## After finding the cookie

1. Go back to the van, and grab the cookie plate
2. Place it so that the Ghost can ate the cookies
   <br>
   I recommend placing the plate on the Ghost Room.
   
3. When the ghost ate the cookie, a Instant Hunt will be started, and the player must survive the hunt.
4. The player must make sure that they have selected the type of ghost at the journal
5. Close the van door, which will complete the mission.
6. Back on the main lobby, the Holiday Sticker for that location should have a green check/tick mark.

The player must complete the objective on all 7 location that has the holiday sticker icon while on Intermediate difficulty:
